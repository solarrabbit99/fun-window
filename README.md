# fun-window

Nothing's fun about it, really... yet! Maybe it would be more than a blank-screen window in the future.

## System Requirements

It probably only works on macOS, and on specific versions. You are welcome to try :I.

## Contributing

You can create a PR and I **will probably approve**. You can also open issues to request for simple features like printing `Hello world!` onto the console.
